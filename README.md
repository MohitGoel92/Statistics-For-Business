# Statistics For Business

This repository contains a full course in statistics that are used in a business environment. Before we get busy with the codes, understanding the fundamentals is crucial when performing analytics and interpreting results. The good news is however, the course is produced in a way that someone who has never studied statistics can learn from the course and make it to the end successfully.
