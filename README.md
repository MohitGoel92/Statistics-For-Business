# Statistics For Business

This repository contains a full course in statistics that are used in a business environment. Before we get busy with the codes, understanding the fundamentals is crucial when performing analytics and interpreting results. The good news is however, the course is produced in a way that someone who has never studied statistics can learn from the course and make it to the end successfully.

I hope you enjoy this course just as much as I have enjoyed making it and teaching it to colleagues and students just like you.

# Section 1: Distribution

In this section, we will be covering the below:

- Continuous Vs Discrete date.
- What is a distribution?
- Standard Deviation.
- Normal Distribution.
- Skewness.
- Mean, Median, Mode.

### Continuous Vs Discrete

**Continuous:** Continuous data is measured, or in other words, it is data that can take any value. Examples include time, height and weight. Because continuous data can take any value, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. [1][2]

**Discrete:** Discrete data is counted. For example, the number of customers who bought different items, the number of computers in each department, and the number of items you buy at the grocery store each week. [1][3]

The diagram below visually depicts the difference between these two data types: [3]
